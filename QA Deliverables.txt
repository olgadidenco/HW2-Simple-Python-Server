1. Run the server as it is and notice what is written to the command window as you click on the links. What is going on here? (Short paragraph or two.)

On the local server, port sits and listens to the requests. A web browser(client) sends a request to the server that includes client IP, date and time, request type and status:
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Feb/2015 22:20:41] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 -

Server processes the request according to what we have specified in HTTPServer.py server file and returns the requested resources to the client.
When we get our page back and click on any of the links, the whole process mentioned above happens again.

If something is not available or not existing (ex. klunk.html) we get the 404 error code saying that file was not found
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Feb/2015 22:20:51] code 404, message File not found: /klunk.htmlelf
Then we receive a message in the command window (with IP, time, request type and status), but this time status is 404 which is a Not Found file error.
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Feb/2015 22:20:51] "GET /klunk.html HTTP/1.1" 404 -

2. With images working on your pages, note what is happening in the command window as you click from page to page.

When we click from page to page we receive GET messages like the once mentioned above for every page requested. 
Each image has it's own GET request which gets processed.

127.0.0.1 - - [17/Feb/2015 22:41:57] "GET /game.html HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Feb/2015 22:42:00] "GET /illusions.html HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Feb/2015 22:42:00] "GET /img/coffee.gif HTTP/1.1" 200 -
